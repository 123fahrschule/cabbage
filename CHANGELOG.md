# Changelog

### v0.2.0
- Support for Scenario Outlines. Scenario Outlines are supported by expanding them into
basic scenarios by filling in all variables. The name of each scenario is appended to have
`(Example x)` where `x` is the row from the `Examples` block in the Scenario Outline. See
https://github.com/cabbage-ex/cabbage/blob/master/test/outline_test.exs for an example.

### v0.1.0

- Initial features to run a simple scenario with variable matching and state tracking.
